Carol S:I had a couple questions: Can you search on multiple things at once umder Label  while using the wild card characters?
Carol S:Does the barcode, label, etc searching care about Capitalization or not? like McGuire, vs. mcguire
Carol S:Thanks! I was wondering, the labels that UAM is using on the tops of their tissues, are these pre printed 2D barcodes
Emily Braker:Do you have any examples of container environment?
Teresa Mayfield (MSB):Capitalization DOES matter for the barcode however.
Shannen:Thank you!  We are looking forward to getting started
