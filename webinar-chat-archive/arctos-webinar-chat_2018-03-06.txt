Lindsay Bloch FLMNH: Thanks! This seems useful as a collections management tool and finding aid. has anyone used it for research?

Lindsay Bloch FLMNH: It seems hard to do anything quantitative beyond counts, as I didn't see places to record measurements, etc

Teresa: Measurements are generally attributes of any given object.

Lindsay Bloch FLMNH: Great, thanks

Teresa: You should request attributes of height, width and depth and any others that seem globally useful!

Hayley (Beneski Museum, Amherst college): Thanks! Really interesting to see the integration of NAGPRA data into Arctos! no specific question :)
