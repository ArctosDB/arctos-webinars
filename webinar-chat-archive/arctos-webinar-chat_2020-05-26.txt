13:42:40	 From  Paula Cushing : Great overview! thanks
13:43:18	 From  meganking : How are the records shared with the volunteers?
13:46:11	 From  Erica Krimmel : Ditto, thanks Phyllis and Anna! I am curious what kinds of geographic resources you find useful for georeferencing marine localities? And how does Arctos manage administrative geographic information (like country) for marine localities that aren't super close to shore?
13:46:44	 From  meganking : Yes georef
13:46:47	 From  meganking : Sorry about that
13:47:01	 From  meganking : Through Symbiota we use crowdsourcing
13:47:21	 From  Teresa.Mayfield-Meyer : Volunteers have access to data entry that is checked by Phyllis before they go into Arctos
13:47:33	 From  meganking : Yes permission
13:48:17	 From  Nuno : will I be able to unmute and participate with my question with direct voice?
13:49:01	 From  Emily M. Braker : Yes. We have a question from Erika then I will call on you
13:49:02	 From  meganking : Okay so they are allowed to create accounts, that answers my question! I wasnâ€™t sure about this so it seems similar to how Symbiota works in this aspect.
13:51:40	 From  Anna Chinn : Yes, only Arctos operators with specific permissions can edit locality information (including georeferencing). Arctos data entry and locality records use Tulane's GEOLocate API, so we've georeferenced using those integrated tools.
13:55:03	 From  Erica Krimmel : Well shoot, I was hoping you guys had solved this problem for all of us haha. Thank you for the insight though!
