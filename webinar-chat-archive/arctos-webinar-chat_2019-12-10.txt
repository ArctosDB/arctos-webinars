  Invertebrate Zoology: (12:56) Let me know when we can test our sound
  Emily Braker: (12:57) I will enable participant microphones at the end of the webinar duroing Q&A, but feel free to ask questions in the chat throughout the presentation!
  Invertebrate Zoology (MCZ): (12:57) Your sound*
  Emily Braker: (12:58) I'll start in 2 minutes
  Mary Beth: (13:02) Yes!
  Mike Baldwin: (13:02) loud and clear
  Invertebrate Zoology (MCZ): (13:03) Working on it
  Emily Braker: (13:36) Arctos is up in Colorado
  Crystal: (13:36) We can still hear and see you!
  Carla Cicero (MVZ): (13:37) arctos is working in Berkeley!
  Carla Cicero (MVZ): (13:41) Derek, do you use GeoLocate to georeference for ento? Maybe show that plugin?
  Crystal: (13:45) We use GeoLocate here at MCZ
  Mary Beth: (13:48) Derek, you didn't enter 15 but 5
  Mary Beth: (13:49) Your original entry was 5
  Sven-Erik Spichiger-WSDA: (13:49) How do you address a collected specimen that is reared to a different life stage later?
  Carla Cicero (MVZ): (13:51) You can also have multiple specimen events for a record, and link parts to a particular event
  Emily Braker: (13:51) Arctos has the ability to note multiple collecting events - so in this case you could have event 1 = collect date, event 2 = date euthanized at a different point in time
  Invertebrate Zoology (MCZ): (13:58) Was that a drag and drop media upload?
  Emily Braker: (13:58) yes, it handles one at a time
  Invertebrate Zoology (MCZ): (13:58) Also,
  Invertebrate Zoology (MCZ): (13:59) Can you Modify saved searches?
  Emily Braker: (14:03) please take survey! http://bit.ly/ArctosEntoSurvey
  Mary Beth: (14:03) Thanks, Derek
  Alana Rivera (MCZ): (14:03) Thank you so much Derek!
  Crystal: (14:03) Thanks a lot!
  Erica Krimmel: (14:03) Thank you!
  Invertebrate Zoology (MCZ): (14:03) Thank you
  Mike Baldwin: (14:04) thanks Derek!
