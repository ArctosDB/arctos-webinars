  Diego Barroso - U of Michigan:Can anyone access the Arctos tools, simply by creating an account on the portal? We use Specify at U of M, but I'd like to try validating my data using these tools before I import it. Thanks.
  Teresa Mayfield (MSB):Erica, would it be possible to use OPenRefine to search the Reptile Database, just as it searched Google Maps?
  Erica Krimmel (NMH Los Angeles):It would be possible if they have an API, but I'm not familiar with Reptile Database so idk if they do
  Aaron Goldberg (UW-Madison):Can Arctos identify duplicates across collecectiond within Arctos?
  Diego Barroso - U of Michigan:OK, great, thanks for the suggestions.
  Aaron Goldberg (UW-Madison):For example, if our collection has a specimen, and there is a duplicate specimen from another collection within Arctos, would you be able to link those specimens together?
  Teresa Mayfield (MSB):If they are parts of the same specimen, yes
  Teresa Mayfield (MSB):Also, specimens collected together can be linked.
  Aaron Goldberg (UW-Madison):Excellent, thanks
