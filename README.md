# Arctos Webinar To Do Checklist 

New webinar moderators need to contact iDigBio for an Adobe Connect login with host permissions. Otherwise the tasks below can be done by anyone.

## Several months in advance...

1. Reserve date/time on iDigBio calendar. *Contact: Molly Phillips*

1. Post the following information as an iDigBio Calendar Announcement:
    - Date and time
    - Title
    - Abstract
    - Presenter/s
    - Moderator/s
    - Links to any relevant pre-reading materials for best experience
    - Link to how to get the most out of Adobe Connect: https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/Web_Conferencing

## One month in advance...

1. Log into Adobe Connect and reserve the appropriate date/time on iDigBio Adobe Connect Room schedule.

1. Set up the post-webinar survey, which can be as generic or specific as desired. Create tinyURL link to post-webinar survey for easier sharing in Adobe connect. *Contact: Shari Ellis*

## One week in advance...

1. Schedule sound check in Adobe Connect (must reserve time!) to meet with presenters and check software, sound, etc. All presenters should do the [Adobe Connect Diagnostic Test](http://idigbio.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm) in advance of this sound check.

1. Copy relevant links (to the post-webinar survey, from the slideshow, etc.) into a place from which you can easy copy-paste them into the chat during the webinar. Participants typically cannot click on links in the presenter's slideshow from within the Adobe Connect environment.

1. Communicate about webinar to relevant communities via the following lists:
    - Arctos User Group (*arctos [at] googlegroups.com*)
    - Arctos Working Group (*arctos-working-group [at] googlegroups.com*)
    - Arctos Steering Committee
    - Collection and data contacts for Arctos institutions
    - iDigBio Newsletter (taken care of by iDigBio)
    - iDigBio-L (*idigbio-l [at] lists.ufl.edu*)
    - NHCOLL-L (*nhcoll-l [at] mailman.yale.edu*)
    - Herbaria-L (*herbaria [at] nacse.org*)

1. Communicate about webinar via Arctos social media. *Contact: AWG Communications Chair, currently Kyndall Hildebrandt)

## Day of the webinar...

1. Communicate again about webinar to relevant communities via the email lists above.

1. Log into Adobe Connect with presenters 60-30 minutes early for a final sound check.

1. Update Adobe Connect pod headings to reflect current Arctos webinar iteration.

1. Ensure the Adobe Connect layout reflects the presentation needs (e.g. large presenter video pod for Q&A, screenshare pod for presentation or live demo).

1. REMEMBER TO RECORD THE WEBINAR!

## After the webinar...

1. Record a transcript of the chat box from the webinar. To do this, use the hamburger dropdown menu on the chat pod to "Email Chat History."

1. Process the webinar recording and share the link on the [Arctos Working Group](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/IDigBio_Working_Groups#Arctos_Working_Group) section of the iDigBio wiki, as well as the [Arctos website](https://arctosdb.org/learn/webinars/).
