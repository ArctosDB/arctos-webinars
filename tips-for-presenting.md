## Tips for presenters

1. Maximize your screen to show the content in the full amount of space (usually this is 125%-150% of normal resolution).
1. Move your cursor at a slow and steady pace. Some participants may be experiencing a lag.
1. Pause and ask the moderator if you need a time check or want to know what's going on in the chat.
1. Move the Adobe Connect box to the lower corner of your window. To participants it looks like a black box covering a portion of your screen.
