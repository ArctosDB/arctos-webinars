4. Set up the post-webinar survey, which can be as generic or specific as desired. Create tinyURL link to post-webinar survey for easier sharing in Adobe connect. *Contact: Shari Ellis*

## One week in advance...

5. Do a sound check in Adobe Connect (must reserve time ahead!) to meet with presenters and check software, sound, etc. All presenters should do the [Adobe Connect Diagnostic Test](http://idigbio.adobeconnect.com/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm) in advance of this sound check.

6. Copy relevant links (to the post-webinar survey, from the slideshow, etc.) into a place from which you can easily copy-paste them into the chat during the webinar. Participants cannot click on links in the presenter's slideshow from within the Adobe Connect environment when the presenter is just sharing their screen.

7. Edit the template for webinar intro slides, either using the powerpoint [here](/arctos-webinar-intro-template.pptx) or the Google slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1164m2A4uvhUtIK-A1RFgYT20lOOenKzD31MQRHBIpnY/edit?usp=sharing).

8. Communicate about webinar to relevant communities via the listservs and other outlets detailed in [email-lists](/email-lists.md).

9. Communicate about webinar via Arctos social media. *Contact: AWG Communications Chair, currently Kyndall Hildebrandt*

## Day of the webinar...

10. Communicate again about webinar to relevant communities via the listservs and other outlets detailed in [email-lists](/email-lists.md).

11. Log into Adobe Connect with presenters 60-30 minutes early for a final sound check.

12. Update Adobe Connect pod headings to reflect current Arctos webinar iteration.

13. Ensure the Adobe Connect layout reflects the presentation needs (e.g. large presenter video pod for Q&A, screenshare pod for presentation or live demo).

14. REMEMBER TO RECORD THE WEBINAR!

## After the webinar...

15. Record a transcript of the chat box from the webinar. To do this, use the hamburger dropdown menu on the chat pod to "Email Chat History." Save transcript in this repository in the [webinar-chat-archive](/webinar-chat-archive) directory.

16. Process the webinar recording as an Mp4, upload it to the [Arctos YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSCkXhrjG-mwLFYRqjNyJA), and share the link on the [Arctos Working Group](https://www.idigbio.org/wiki/index.php/IDigBio_Working_Groups#Arctos_Working_Group) section of the iDigBio wiki, as well as the [Arctos website](https://arctosdb.org/learn/webinars).

17. Archive the post-webinar survey results in the [webinar-survey-results](/webinar-survey-results) directory. iDigBio will email these as a Word document to whoever moderated the webinar.
